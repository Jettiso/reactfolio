            <p>Hi! My name is Jet. I'm a developer.</p>

            <p>
                At the age of 12 I discovered programming & coding. My first
                ever language was JavaScript. Little did I know that I'd grow up
                to be a developer that is heavily focused in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>I very much enjoy creating aestheticaly pleasing websites with amazing user experience</p>
        </div>
