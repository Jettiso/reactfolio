                <p>
                    At the age of 12 I discovered programming & coding. My first ever language was JavaScript. Little
                    did I know that I'd grow up to be a developer that is heavily focused in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>I very much enjoy creating aesthetically pleasing websites with amazing user experience</p>
